# Sintetic base dataset

Implementation, for Convolutional Neural Network training, of computer vision transformations to produce labels corresponding to target bases in a synthetic images dataset - created from Blender.

### Files

Arena.blender: Arena modeled in Blender. For the wallpapers to be added, the .png files must be in the same directory as the .blender files.

Blender.py: contains classes (and methods) useful for creating the dataset, in particular defined for the reference systems within which the transformations take place (camera and image).

Dataset.py: effectively implements the creation of the dataset from Blender.
